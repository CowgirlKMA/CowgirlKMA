- 👋 Hi, I’m @CowgirlKMA. 
- 👀 I’m interested in learning new things to keep my mind sharp. I am an animal lover. I have a horse, dogs, chickens and a conure. I plan to be living on a hobby farm within the next few years and adding to my zoo. Life is short and I want to make the most of it doing what makes me happy.
- 🌱 I currently gradutated from Coding Dojo. I completed their full stack program learning Python in 18 weeks! If I can handle that, well.... I can do anything I put my mind to. I also have experience in JavaScript, HTML, CSS, SQL, Flask, Jinja, Bootstrap, MySql, Balsamiq, MySQL Workbench, Git, GitHub, Cmder, VS Code, BCrypt, OOP, DOM, UI/UX, CRUD, and Responsive Design. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that will help me to become a better programmer and sharpen my skills.

- ⚡ Fun fact: I've ridden my horse, Nugget, several times in the National Western Stock Show Parade here in Denver.
