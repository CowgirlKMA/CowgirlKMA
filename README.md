- 👋 Hi, I’m @CowgirlKMA. 
- 👀 I’m interested in learning new things to keep my mind sharp. I have a horse, dogs, chickens and a conure. I plan to be living on a hobby farm within the next few years and adding to my critters.
- 🌱 I currently gradutated from Coding Dojo. I completed their full stack program learning Python in 18 weeks! If I can handle that, well.... I can do anything I put my mind to. I also have experience in JavaScript, HTML, CSS, SQL, Flask, Jinja, Bootstrap, and MySql. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that will help me to become a better programmer and sharpen my skills.
- 📫 You can reach me here on GitHub, or LinkedIn www.linkedin.com/in/katherine-ayers, or email kmildredayers@gmail.com
- ⚡ Fun fact: I've ridden my horse, Nugget, several times in the National Western Stock Show Parade here in Denver.
